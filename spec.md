# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
- [x] Pull data from an external source : I've pulled data from both the page that has the main list of heroes on the Overwatch site, and data from the individual hero pages that provides detailed information about each of the heroes (different pages for each hero).
- [ ] Implement both list and detail views
