# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application : I created a CLI that shows the user a roster of heroes and allows them to either see more information about a specific hero, see the list again, or exit the program.
- [x] Pull data from an external source : I've pulled data from both the page that has the main list of heroes on the Overwatch site, and data from the individual hero pages that provides detailed information about each of the heroes (different pages for each hero).
- [x] Implement both list and detail views : My program starts by pulling a list of current heroes from the Overwatch website and displaying it to the user. It also shows the user detail views for each of the heroes, which was also scraped from the Overwatch site.
