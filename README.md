# OwHeroesRoster

Welcome to the Overwatch Heroes Roster Gem! This gem will show you a list of all the current heroes available in the video game Overwatch. You can also see more detailed information about each individual hero if you wish.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ow_heroes_roster'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ow_heroes_roster

## Usage

When you run the program you will see a list of instructions and the current roster of heroes. To view more information about a hero, type their name when prompted (alternatively, you can also type 'roster' to see the list again, or 'exit' if you are done with the program).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
